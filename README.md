### Project Description ###

This project will be a multiplayer game (taken from the medieval Scandinavian term for dueling), where two people race to create a function that solves a given problem.

Create a page with two different text areas. Allow two users to log in, one for each text area. 

Prompt the users with a challenge function, such as the "Fizz-Buzz" problem. Both users will have to write a function that meets the given parameters, and returns the correct results. 

Both users will be able to see the other's code in real time. The first player to successfully complete the function wins. 

We will keep track of score. Users will have to create accounts, complete with user authentication.
